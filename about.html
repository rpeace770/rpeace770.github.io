		<p>I started as a music major at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX in 2005. I realized that art was my main passion, so I transferred to the University of North Texas to study Studio Art. After two years in Denton, I transferred to the University of Texas and received a B.F.A. in Studio Art and a B.A. in Geography.</p>
		<p>After I graduated, I enrolled in the iTeachTexas Certification Program and started teaching Elementary Music in Elgin, TX. Here I realized that I enjoyed working with people, but needed to move to a different field of work.</p>
		<p>I am currently working on a Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the University of Texas Medical Branch.</p>
